# C++ File Operations Menu

This C++ program provides a menu for performing file operations, including sorting text within a file and encrypting text within a file.

## Usage

1. **Compile the Code:**
   - Compile the C++ code using your preferred compiler. For example:
     ```bash
     g++ your_file_name.cpp -o your_executable_name
     ```

2. **Run the Executable:**
   - Execute the compiled program:
     ```bash
     ./your_executable_name
     ```

3. **Follow the Menu:**
   - The program will display a menu with the following options:
     - 1. Sort text within file
     - 2. Encrypt text within file

4. **Enter File Name:**
   - When prompted, enter the name of the file you want to perform operations on.

5. **Perform Operations:**
   - Choose the corresponding number for the operation you want to perform.
     - Option 1: Sorts the text within the file and saves the result in "Sorted.txt".
     - Option 2: Encrypts the text within the file and saves the result in "Encrypted.txt". It uses a simple ASCII shifting encryption with the character '&'.

6. **Repeat or Exit:**
   - After completing an operation, you can choose to perform another operation or exit the program.
